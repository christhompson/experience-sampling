      ("Google").

      <h3>Purpose of the study</h3>
      <p>We are looking to better understand how people interpret and
      interact with Chrome and the Web during certain infrequent
      events, such as Chrome notifications.</p>

      <h3>Procedure</h3>
      <p>You will be required to install a Chrome browser extension
      (small piece of software) in the Chrome browser on your
      computer.  The browser extension will detect when you’ve
      experienced an infrequent event, like seeing a Chrome
      notification, while browsing so that we can ask you to answer
      a simple survey about your response to the event.  We may
      also collect diagnostic, system, and contextual information such
      as browser version, OS, and the URL of the page you were on when
      the survey appeared. We would like to run the study over a
      period of four months.   During this time, we do not expect you
      to change your normal web browsing behavior.  The number of
      surveys that you are shown will depend on how often you
      encounter such events during your normal browsing. Google may
      update the extension from time to time to change the available
      survey questions.  We expect that each survey will take 2-3
      minutes to complete.  Upon conclusion of the study, we will
      remove the extension from your computer.</p>

      <h3>Potential Risks</h3>
      <p>Each browser extension will contain a randomly generated ID
      number to enable us to group survey responses from a single
      participant.  You can reset this ID number by uninstalling and
      reinstalling the extension. If you provide identifying
      information in response to any of the survey questions, then
      Google may know personal information about you and will be able
      to associate it with your other responses in the study.  You
      should only provide information that you are comfortable sharing
      with Google.  Otherwise, there are no special risks associated
      with the study beyond the risks posed by normal internet usage.</p>

      <h3>Privacy and Confidentiality</h3>
      <p>All logged data will be stored on a secure Google server
      accessible only to the researchers involved in this study. Any
      information that is obtained in connection with this study and
      could identify you will remain confidential within Google.
      Google may, however, publish the results of this study along
      with data collected from the study in an aggregated form, and
      may publish quotes from your survey responses as long
      as they don’t contain personally identifiable information.</p>

      <h3>Data Use</h3>
      <p>The survey responses that you provide to Google will be used to
      improve Google's products and services.</p>

      <h3>Participation and Withdrawal</h3>
      <p>Your participation in this research study is voluntary and you may
      withdraw at any time. You may remove the study extension at any time by
      following <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/113907?hl=en">these
      instructions</a>. Any survey responses that you have already
      submitted will continue to be part of the study data.</p>

      <h3>Identification of Investigators</h3>
      <p>If you have any questions or concerns about the research, please feel
      free to contact: Rob Reeder, chrome-experience-sampling@google.com</p>
